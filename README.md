# Two-digit Counter

## Overview

This project involves designing and implementing a two-digit digital counter using IC 555 and IC 4026 for 7-segment displays. The counter counts from 0 to 99 and then resets. The project demonstrates fundamental concepts in digital electronics and has applications in various fields, including signal processing, timing, and control systems.

## Project Details

### The Idea

A digital counter circuit is an electronic circuit that counts and records the number of events or pulses. Counters are fundamental components in digital electronics and find applications in various fields. They are implemented using flip-flops and combinational logic gates to achieve the counting functionality.

In this project, we use IC 555 and IC 4026 to drive a 7-segment display, allowing the counter to count from 0 to 99 and then reset.

### Components

- IC 555
- IC 4026
- 7-segment display
- Resistors, capacitors, and other supporting components

## How to Use

1. Assemble the circuit as per the schematic and PCB layout provided.
2. Power the circuit using a suitable power source.
3. Observe the counting on the 7-segment display as the circuit counts from 0 to 99 and then resets.
